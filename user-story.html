<h2>User Story</h2>
<h3>Instructor</h3>

<p>As an instructor user, I want to be able to easily navigate a single web application in which student input data can be introduced, voted on & ranked. </p>

<h3>Student</h3>

<p>As a student user, I want access to a straight forward web application that allows me to either use my cnm credentials, or create an account with new ones where I can submit my ideas to then be voted on for our capstone group project, in addition to then voting and ranking on our idea submissions. </p>
