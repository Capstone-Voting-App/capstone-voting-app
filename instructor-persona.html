        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>Name: Monty Fibonacci</p>
        <p>Age: 71</p>
        <h3>Profession</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Coder extraordinaire; javascript ninja; deep dive master instructor.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p> Monty is a linux superuser. He teaches both in person and remotely through a variety of operating systems (linux, windows, macOS) as well all modern browsers for different functions. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>He codes before, during, and after work, often creating fully-functioning mobile games from scratch to deployment in 3 hours and 50 minutes. However, he does not know how to code a voting app.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p> With every new cohort comes the need for capstone project ideas to be listed, filtered, selected, and assigned. The instructor currently has to use 4 different applications and multiple screens causing delays in screen sharing, data loss, and an inefficient process for topic selection.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Monty wants an application that allows the cohort members/instructors to list all topic ideas, filter them out, allow students to vote, and store valid ideas in a database for future use. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>As an Instructor, I need an application that allows an easy interface to list, delete, and vote on capstone ideas.</p>
        </div>
